/*
Keyword - keywords are the reserved word whose meaning is already defined in the java compiler.

Identifiers are called name used as variable name like String newIdentifier like this.

null, true, false used as a literals in java. 50 keywords + 3 literals.

Note - 1) We can't use keywords as a variable name, method name.
2) keywords are the case-sensitive.

Identifiers refer to the name of variables, methods, classes and so on.
for eg- int a; here a is identifier
void m1 - m1 is literal
class A - A is literal

ALL IDENTIFIERS ARE NOT VARIABLE BUT ALL VARIABLE NAME CAN BE IDENTIFIER.
